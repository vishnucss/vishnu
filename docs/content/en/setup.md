All very simple, you can install it in two ways. First using npm/yarn the other importing directly into your code.

## Complete Install

Add `@vishnucss/vishnu` dependency to your project:

<code-group>
  <code-block label="YARN" active>

```bash
yarn add @vishnucss/vishnu
```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="CDN">

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@vishnucss/vishnu" />
```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

Ready! That's it, now just use the library.

This is the complete installation, but let's say you want to use only a few parts. See the next steps
